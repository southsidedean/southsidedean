### Bio

I've had the pleasure of working with physical, virtual, Cloud and Cloud Native technologies for many years. In these roles I have worn many hats â€“ educator, team lead, architect, engineer, project manager, business advocate and more. I have many years of both pre-sales and post-sales experience as an architect and engineer and can speak to a wide variety of both technical and non-technical audiences. My experience leveraging process and automation helps me to achieve fast, accurate and consistent results. I'm a creative problem solver with the ability to think outside of the box.

I added teaching and content production to my skill set over three years ago, so I could leverage over 25 years of technology experience to create great courses with lessons and hands-on labs to help my students master technology, changing lives for the better.

Along the way, I've been a student as well, learning how to write, record, edit and produce my own content, create and deploy labs in AWS using CloudFormation and Terraform/Ansible, and expanding my Cloud, Cloud Native and adjacent subject matter knowledge, to become a more well-rounded technologist. I'm currently working on attaining the Cloud Native Computing Foundation's CKA and CKAD certifications.

At D2iQ, I led the Learning and Development function, managing the day-to-day and strategic operations of content development and class delivery, including building, improving, optimizing and maintaining an in-house automated hands-on labs platform in Amazon Web Services (AWS), using GitLab, CI/CD, Terraform and Packer to deliver valuable hands-on experiences for students.

Throughout 2022, I also led a selection process to select a learning management system and accompanying hands-on labs system to make a pivot to on-demand learning. I evaluated the scope of public offerings for Learning Management Systems (Docebo, Skilljar, Blackboard, Instructure, Appsembler and more) and hands-on labs systems (CloudShare, Skillable, Instruqt, Appsembler and more). I spent the end of 2022 integrating our selection of Docebo and CloudShare so we could fill it with content and labs and launch in early 2023.

Let's build something great together!
