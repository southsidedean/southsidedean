## About Me

In my career, I've had the pleasure of working with physical / virtual and Cloud / Cloud Native technologies for many years. In these roles I have worn many hats â€“ educator, team lead, architect, engineer, project manager, business advocate and more. I have many years of both pre-sales and post-sales experience as an architect and engineer and can speak to a wide variety of both technical and non-technical audiences. My experience leveraging process and automation helps me to achieve fast, accurate and consistent results. I'm a creative problem solver with the ability to think outside of the box.

I made the jump from practicing to teaching over three years ago so I could leverage over 25 years of technology experience to create great courses with lessons and hands-on labs to help my students achieve their learning goals, changing their lives for the better. Along the way, I've been a student as well, learning how to record, edit and produce my own content, create labs in AWS using CloudFormation and Terraform/Ansible, and expanding my Cloud, Cloud Native and adjacent subject matter knowledge, to become a more well-rounded technologist. I'm currently working on attaining the Cloud Native Computing Foundation's CKA and CKAD certifications.

In my last position at D2iQ, I was in charge of Learning and Development, and managed the day-to-day and strategic operations of content development and class delivery, including building, improving, optimizing and maintaining an in-house automated hands-on labs platform in Amazon Web Services (AWS), using GitLab and Terraform to deliver valuable hands-on experience for our students.

Throughout 2022, I also led a selection process to select a learning management system and accompanying hands-on labs system to make a pivot to on-demand learning. I evaluated the scope of public offerings for learning management systems (Docebo, Skilljar, Blackboard, Instructure, Appsembler and more) and hands-on labs systems (CloudShare, Skillable, Instruqt , Appsembler and more). I spent the end of 2022 integrating our selection of Docebo and CloudShare so we could fill it with content and labs and launch in early 2023.

I'm ex-Linux Academy and ex-A Cloud Guru | A Pluralsight Company, two of the finest e-learning companies out there. I can bring that experience to your product and customers.

I truly enjoy what I do and take pride in my work. Let's educate the world on your products and technologies. I'm ready to go at a moment's notice!
