## About Me

### Summary

I'm a seasoned technologist, looking for direct-hire or W2 contract roles.  I'm available on short-notice.

Top Skills:

- Linux
- Kubernetes
- Cloud (AWS and a little Azure and GCP)
- Cloud Native (Containers, Docker/Podman and Kubernetes)
- Automation (Terraform, CloudFormation, Bash and some Python)

### Biography

I've had the pleasure of working with physical, virtual, Cloud and Cloud Native technologies for many years. I have worn many hats â€“ educator, team lead, architect, engineer, project manager, business advocate and more, with both pre-sales and post-sales experience.  I can speak to a wide variety of both technical and non-technical audiences. My experience leveraging process and automation helps me to achieve fast, accurate and consistent results.

I'm a big believer in documenting all things and sharing the knowledge, both written (GitHub) and video (YouTube).  I like leaving things better than I found them, and wrangling, documenting and automating tribal knowledge along the way.

I added teaching and content production to my skill set over three years ago, so I could leverage over 25 years of technology experience to create great courses with lessons and hands-on labs to help my students master technology, changing lives for the better.  Along the way, I've been a student as well, learning how to write, record, edit and produce my own content and create and deploy labs in AWS using CloudFormation and Terraform.

I've been expanding my Cloud, Cloud Native and adjacent subject matter knowledge to become a more well-rounded technologist. I'm currently working on attaining the Cloud Native Computing Foundation's CKA and CKAD certifications.

In my last role at D2iQ, I led the Learning and Development function, managing the day-to-day and strategic operations of content development and class delivery, including building, improving, optimizing and maintaining an in-house automated hands-on labs platform in Amazon Web Services (AWS), using GitLab, CI/CD, Terraform and Packer to deliver valuable hands-on experiences for students.

Throughout 2022, I led a selection process to select a learning management system and accompanying hands-on labs system to make a pivot to on-demand learning. I evaluated the scope of public offerings for Learning Management Systems (Docebo, Skilljar, Blackboard, Instructure, Appsembler and more) and hands-on labs systems (CloudShare, Skillable, Instruqt, Appsembler and more). I spent the end of 2022 integrating our selection of Docebo and CloudShare so we could fill it with content and labs and launch in early 2023.

Let's build something great together!
