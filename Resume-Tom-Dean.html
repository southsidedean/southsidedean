<p>I'm a seasoned technologist, looking for direct-hire or W2 contract roles in a remote-first capacity.  I'm available on short notice.</p>
<p><strong>Top Skills:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Linux (Ross Brunson and I wrote the RHCSA 8 course for A Cloud Guru)</li>
<li>Kubernetes (KCNA | CKAD | CKA)</li>
<li>Cloud (AWS CCP (working on SAA) and a little Azure and GCP)</li>
<li>Cloud Native (Containers, Docker/Podman and Kubernetes)</li>
<li>Automation (Terraform, CloudFormation, Bash and some Python)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="biography"><strong>Biography</strong></h2>
<p>I've had the pleasure of working with physical, virtual, Cloud and Cloud Native technologies for many years. I have worn many hats â€“ educator, team lead, architect, engineer, project manager, business advocate and more, with both pre-sales and post-sales experience.  I can speak to a wide variety of both technical and non-technical audiences. My experience leveraging process and automation helps me to achieve fast, accurate and consistent results.</p>
<p>I'm a big believer in documenting all things and sharing the knowledge, both written (GitHub) and video (YouTube).  I like leaving things better than I found them, and wrangling, documenting and automating tribal knowledge along the way.</p>
<p>I added teaching and content production to my skill set over three years ago, so I could leverage over 25 years of technology experience to create great courses with lessons and hands-on labs to help my students master technology, changing lives for the better.  Along the way, I've been a student as well, learning how to write, record, edit and produce my own content and create and deploy labs in AWS using CloudFormation and Terraform.</p>
<p>I've been expanding my Cloud, Cloud Native and adjacent subject matter knowledge to become a more well-rounded technologist. I recently attained the Cloud Native Computing Foundation's CKA and CKAD certifications, as well as the AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner certification.  I'm currently studying for the AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Associate exam.</p>
<p>Let's build something great together!</p>

<h4 id="nov-2023---jan-2024--greater-chicago-area--remote">Nov 2023 - Jan 2024 Â· Greater Chicago Area Â· Remote</h4>
<p>I joined Mission Cloud as a Technical Training Architect in November of 2023.</p>
<p>My responsibilities included:</p>
<ul>
<li>Technical certification and up-skilling of employees (AWS | Kubernetes | Python | Terraform )</li>
<li>The Technical Ambassador program</li>
<li>The Subject Matter Expert program</li>
<li>Technical Training Content (Curation and Creation) and Training Paths</li>
<li>The &quot;second half&quot; of the Apprenticeship program</li>
</ul>
<p>There was a corporate re-organization at the beginning of January 2024, and I was one of the many Mission employees impacted by layoffs.</p>

<h4 id="aug-2021---feb-2023--greater-chicago-area--remote">Aug 2021 - Feb 2023 Â· Greater Chicago Area Â· Remote</h4>
<p>As a principal on my team at D2iQ, I owned the Learning and Development function and managed the day-to-day and strategic operations of content development and class delivery.</p>
<p>I was in charge of maintaining and delivering a catalog of instructor-led courses that included the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) space and a growing catalog of other Kubernetes topics, for both internal and external students, including building, improving, optimizing and maintaining an in-house, automated hands-on labs platform in Amazon Web Services (AWS), using GitLab, CI/CD and Terraform to deliver valuable hands-on experience for our students.</p>
<p>Throughout 2022, I also led a selection process to select a learning management system and accompanying hands-on labs system to make a pivot to on-demand learning. I evaluated the scope of public offerings for learning management systems (Docebo, Skilljar, Blackboard, Instructure, Appsembler and more) and hands-on labs systems (CloudShare, Skillable, Instruqt , Appsembler and more). I spent the end of 2022 integrating our selection of Docebo and CloudShare so we could fill it with content and labs and launch in early 2023. Unfortunately, the project was cancelled in early 2023 and my position was eliminated.</p>
<div style="page-break-after: always"></div>
<p>In my role, I not only led, but was hands-on, from writing Terraform automation in GitLab to build lab environments in AWS, to advancing my fledgling Kubernetes skills every day as both a student and a teacher.</p>

<p>During my six-month assignment, I led a team of Linux Engineers supporting a rollout of Manhattan WMS and the supporting Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL 6/7) environment. I performed engineering and architecture work to standardize and automate many aspects of the Linux environment. I also led the team on documenting a largely undocumented environment, creating standardized procedures and processes and improved the efficiency and stability of day-to-day operations. The RHEL environment was a mix of virtual (VMWare) and physical (Cisco UCS and HP C7000) connected to EMC storage (with PowerPath). I created and tested the first set of Disaster Recovery (DR) procedures for the environment as well.</p>

<p>ITDistributors (ITD) was an Edison, NJ based VAR that serviced the telecommunications industry, both as a traditional VAR as well as a provider of frame integration services.</p>
<p>My tenure at ITD had two chapters. In the first two years I served as a Technical Account Manager (TAM) working with Alcatel-Lucent and Motorola. I worked alongside the Sun Microsystems team to add value to the relationship with Sun/ITD. In 2011 I was assigned to AT&amp;T to not only perform in a TAM role but to identify, win and lead a number of projects. Most of these projects were large deployments of Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL 5/6) on IBM BladeCenter servers connected to Hitachi AMS2500 storage with many nodes across many sites, all deployed with custom automation (Kickstart / PXE / Bash).</p>
<p>As AT&amp;T began their move toward retooling on OpenStack I was tapped to be one of two key players in our partnership with Red Hat. In this role I achieved all available Red Hat Partner Platform, Virtualization and Cloud certifications that were available and trained ITD's internal engineering teams on these technologies.</p>
<p>My role with ITD ended in June 2015 as a result of a reduction in force, prior to the closing of the company.</p>
