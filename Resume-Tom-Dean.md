## Summary

I've had the pleasure of working with physical, virtual, Cloud and Cloud Native technologies for many years. In these roles I have worn many hats – educator, team lead, architect, engineer, project manager, business advocate and more. I have many years of both pre-sales and post-sales experience as an architect and engineer and can speak to a wide variety of both technical and non-technical audiences. My experience leveraging process and automation helps me to achieve fast, accurate and consistent results. I'm a creative problem solver with the ability to think outside of the box.

I added teaching and content production to my skillset over three years ago, so I could leverage over 25 years of technology experience to create great courses with lessons and hands-on labs to help my students master technology, changing lives for the better.

Along the way, I've been a student as well, learning how to write, record, edit and produce my own content, create and deploy labs in AWS using CloudFormation and Terraform/Ansible, and expanding my Cloud, Cloud Native and adjacent subject matter knowledge, to become a more well-rounded technologist. I'm currently working on attaining the Cloud Native Computing Foundation's CKA and CKAD certifications.

At D2iQ, I led the Learning and Development function, managing the day-to-day and strategic operations of content development and class delivery, including building, improving, optimizing and maintaining an in-house automated hands-on labs platform in Amazon Web Services (AWS), using GitLab, CICD and Terraform and Packer to deliver valuable hands-on experiences for students.

Throughout 2022, I also led a selection process to select a learning management system and accompanying hands-on labs system to make a pivot to on-demand learning. I evaluated the scope of public offerings for learning management systems (Docebo, Skilljar, Blackboard, Instructure, Appsembler and more) and hands-on labs systems (CloudShare, Skillable, Instruqt , Appsembler and more). I spent the end of 2022 integrating our selection of Docebo and CloudShare so we could fill it with content and labs and launch in early 2023.

I'm ex-Linux Academy and ex-A Cloud Guru | A Pluralsight Company, two of the finest e-learning companies out there. I can bring that experience to your product and customers.

I truly enjoy what I do and take pride in my work. Let's build something great together! I'm ready to go at a moment's notice.

## Experience

### Education Curriculum Architect/Developer
#### D2iQ · Full-time

Aug 2021 - Feb 2023
Greater Chicago Area · Remote

As a principal on my team at D2iQ, I owned the Learning and Development function and managed the day-to-day and strategic operations of content development and class delivery.

I was in charge of maintaining and delivering a catalog of instructor-led courses that included the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) space and a growing catalog of other Kubernetes topics, for both internal and external students, including building, improving, optimizing and maintaining an in-house, automated hands-on labs platform in Amazon Web Services (AWS), using GitLab, CI/CD and Terraform to deliver valuable hands-on experience for our students.

I spent the end of 2022 integrating our selection of Docebo and CloudShare so we could fill it with content and labs and launch in early 2023. Unfortunately, the project was cancelled in early 2023 and my position was eliminated.

In my role, I not only led, but was hands-on, from writing Terraform automation in GitLab to build lab environments in AWS, to advancing my fledgling Kubernetes skills every day as both a student and a teacher.As a principal on my team at D2iQ, I owned the Learning and Development function and managed the day-to-day and strategic operations of content development and class delivery.

My role with Lucid was a three month assignment at Indiana University. In that role, I was in charge of retiring / transitioning applications and services on a number of Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) servers, as well as providing interim support for the customers during the transition. The servers were a mix of RHEL 5/6/7 on VMWare (with vRA). In this role I was not just an architect and engineer, but also a project manager in charge of building customer relationships to assure success.My role with Lucid was a three month assignment at Indiana University.
