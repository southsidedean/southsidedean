## Summary

I've had the pleasure of working with physical, virtual, Cloud and Cloud Native technologies for many years. In these roles I have worn many hats – educator, team lead, architect, engineer, project manager, business advocate and more. I have many years of both pre-sales and post-sales experience as an architect and engineer and can speak to a wide variety of both technical and non-technical audiences. My experience leveraging process and automation helps me to achieve fast, accurate and consistent results. I'm a creative problem solver with the ability to think outside of the box.

I added teaching and content production to my skill set over three years ago, so I could leverage over 25 years of technology experience to create great courses with lessons and hands-on labs to help my students master technology, changing lives for the better.

Along the way, I've been a student as well, learning how to write, record, edit and produce my own content, create and deploy labs in AWS using CloudFormation and Terraform/Ansible, and expanding my Cloud, Cloud Native and adjacent subject matter knowledge, to become a more well-rounded technologist. I'm currently working on attaining the Cloud Native Computing Foundation's CKA and CKAD certifications.

At D2iQ, I led the Learning and Development function, managing the day-to-day and strategic operations of content development and class delivery, including building, improving, optimizing and maintaining an in-house automated hands-on labs platform in Amazon Web Services (AWS), using GitLab, CI/CD, Terraform and Packer to deliver valuable hands-on experiences for students.

Throughout 2022, I also led a selection process to select a learning management system and accompanying hands-on labs system to make a pivot to on-demand learning. I evaluated the scope of public offerings for Learning Management Systems (Docebo, Skilljar, Blackboard, Instructure, Appsembler and more) and hands-on labs systems (CloudShare, Skillable, Instruqt, Appsembler and more). I spent the end of 2022 integrating our selection of Docebo and CloudShare so we could fill it with content and labs and launch in early 2023.

Let's build something great together!

## Experience

### Education Curriculum Architect/Developer
#### D2iQ · Full-time

Aug 2021 - Feb 2023
Greater Chicago Area · Remote

As a principal on my team at D2iQ, I owned the Learning and Development function and managed the day-to-day and strategic operations of content development and class delivery.

I was in charge of maintaining and delivering a catalog of instructor-led courses that included the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) space and a growing catalog of other Kubernetes topics, for both internal and external students, including building, improving, optimizing and maintaining an in-house, automated hands-on labs platform in Amazon Web Services (AWS), using GitLab, CI/CD and Terraform to deliver valuable hands-on experience for our students.

Throughout 2022, I also led a selection process to select a learning management system and accompanying hands-on labs system to make a pivot to on-demand learning. I evaluated the scope of public offerings for learning management systems (Docebo, Skilljar, Blackboard, Instructure, Appsembler and more) and hands-on labs systems (CloudShare, Skillable, Instruqt , Appsembler and more). I spent the end of 2022 integrating our selection of Docebo and CloudShare so we could fill it with content and labs and launch in early 2023. Unfortunately, the project was cancelled in early 2023 and my position was eliminated.

In my role, I not only led, but was hands-on, from writing Terraform automation in GitLab to build lab environments in AWS, to advancing my fledgling Kubernetes skills every day as both a student and a teacher.

### Senior Systems Architect
#### ITDistributors · Full-time

Jul 2009 - Jun 2015
Greater Chicago Area · Hybrid

ITDistributors (ITD) was an Edison, NJ based VAR that serviced the telecommunications industry, both as a traditional VAR as well as a provider of frame integration services. 

My tenure at ITD had two chapters. In the first two years I served as a Technical Account Manager (TAM) working with Alcatel-Lucent and Motorola. I worked alongside the Sun Microsystems team to add value to the relationship with Sun/ITD. In 2011 I was assigned to AT&T to not only perform in a TAM role but to identify, win and lead a number of projects. Most of these projects were large deployments of Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL 5/6) on IBM BladeCenter servers connected to Hitachi AMS2500 storage with many nodes across many sites, all deployed with custom automation (Kickstart / PXE / Bash).

As AT&T began their move toward retooling on OpenStack I was tapped to be one of two key players in our partnership with Red Hat. In this role I achieved all available Red Hat Partner Platform, Virtualization and Cloud certifications that were available and trained ITD's internal engineering teams on these technologies.

My role with ITD ended in June 2015 as a result of a reduction in force, prior to the closing of the company.
